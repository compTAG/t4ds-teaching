## T4DS Event Schedule

The following table contains the rough schedule used during the T4DS workshop. 
In general, the timing of each tutorial seemed sufficient to build onto susequent tutorials.
We supplemented sessions with office hours to clear issues in understanding, and
answered additional questions from participants during breaks.

For reference, our workshop was hosted at the Bozeman Event Space, in the 
North Ballroom (14 S. Tracy Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715). We had access to projectors and TVs,
and sat roughly three participants per table. We encouraged students to switch their seating
arrangements in order to make new connections.

Dinner and a panel (especially if one has access to funding for these events), seemed to be
a beneficial addition to the workshop. We recieved verbal feedback that the panel
with a wide array of data science professionals was especially helpful. The panel included
faculty in math, cs, statistics, and programming/data science industry careers.
