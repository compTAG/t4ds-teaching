## T4DS Event Advertising

We advertised the event to math, statistics, and computer science departments 
throughout the region. This included direct communication with all colleges and 
universities in Montana
(including community and tribal colleges), and the flagship institutions in 
neighboring states (NDSU, UND, U of Idaho, Boise State, U of Wyoming). We also 
targeted large email chains and slack groups involving diverse departments
throughout the country. These included ASA sections, Berkeley Data Science,
cg-announce, WiML, WinCompTop, and others.
Our advertising was mostly 
successful, although we perhaps should've advertised more thoroughly in person
to MSU students, as well as to Montana colleges and universities more broadly.


## T4DS Event Schedule

The following table contains the rough schedule used during the T4DS workshop. 
In general, the timing of each tutorial seemed sufficient to build onto susequent 
tutorials. We supplemented sessions with office hours to clear issues in 
understanding, and answered additional questions from participants during breaks.
We found that it was especially helpful

## T4DS Event Venue

For reference, our workshop was hosted at the Bozeman Event Space, in the 
North Ballroom (14 S. Tracy Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715). We had access to projectors and 
TVs, and sat roughly three participants per table. We encouraged students to switch 
their 
seating arrangements in order to make new connections.

## T4DS Panel

Dinner and a panel (especially if one has access to funding for these events), seemed 
to be a beneficial addition to the workshop. We recieved verbal feedback that the 
panel with a wide array of data science professionals was especially helpful. The 
panel included faculty in math, cs, statistics, and programming/data science industry 
careers. The panel was led by a current undergraduate student who has worked in our
group for several years, and was a peer for audience members.

## T4DS Event Assessment

Assessment is an important step that should not be forgotten. When designing
your assessment, consider the reason for offering the assessment:

* Do you plan to offer this workshop again and want to know how to improve it?
* Do you need to report to a funding agency?
* Do you plan to use the results in research? (If so, don't forget the IRB!)

See the [T4DS exit survey](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds-training/assets/T4DS-exit-survey.pdf)
as an example. You are welcome to use this one, or create your own.  When
creating your own, we suggest trying to find surveys that have been used before
rather than reinventing the wheel from scratch.

Note: it is perfectly ok to slip in assessment questions in the
[application/registration](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds-training/assets/T4DS-app.pdf).

Breakout room: how would different reasons for needing assessments affect the
types of questions that you might ask?
