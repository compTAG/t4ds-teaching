## T4DS Event Advertising

We advertised the event to math, statistics, and computer science departments 
throughout the region. This included direct communication with all colleges and 
universities in Montana
(including community and tribal colleges), and the larger institutions in 
neighboring states (NDSU, UND, U of Idaho, Boise State, U of Wyoming). We also 
targeted large email chains and slack groups involving diverse departments
throughout the country. These included ASA sections, Berkeley Data Science,
cg-announce, WiML, WinCompTop, and others.
Our advertising was mostly successful,
although next time we would likely advertise more thoroughly in person
to MSU students, more specifically to local students in Montana.

For reference, our full advertising materials are located in the dropdowns below:

On 21-22 April 2023, the Topology for Data Science (T4DS) workshop will immerse 50 undergraduate 
students in the fast-growing area of data science, through the lens of topology. The workshop will be 
held in Bozeman, MT. T4DS will start with an overview of how to "think with data" through data 
exploration and visualization in R, continuing with a brief journey into the field of topology and 
how to use topological descriptors to summarize data. On the second day, participants will 
investigate the shape of Montana's glaciers using those topological descriptors. The workshop will 
also include a panel of faculty members and current graduate students who will speak about their 
experiences with including undergraduates in research and potential career opportunities in data 
science.

All undergraduates are encouraged to apply, regardless of major. The only prerequisite is a level of 
mathematics or computer science equivalent to a first year undergraduate course sequence, and a 
desire to try something new! Travel funding is available for up to 25 workshop participants. The 
conference website and workshop application can be found at http://www.montana.edu/datascience. 
Priority will be given to applications received before 31 January 2023.

If you are a faculty member and would be interested in being on the panel, please contact us using 
the email below.

Please feel free to forward this email or distribute the attached flyer as you see fit.

We look forward to taking you on this journey through the topological data analysis cycle!

## T4DS Event Schedule

The following table contains the rough schedule used during the T4DS workshop. 
In general, the timing of each tutorial seemed sufficient to build onto susequent 
tutorials. We supplemented sessions with office hours to clear issues in 
understanding, and answered additional questions from participants during breaks.
We found that it was especially helpful to take extra time on hands on activities,
and to work through simple examples first with a TA, and then together on a 
whiteboard. Based on our feedback, the glacier data activity seemed to be a 
successful culmination of the skills gathered throughout the workshop.

## T4DS Event Venue

For reference, our workshop was hosted at the Bozeman Event Space, in the 
North Ballroom (14 S. Tracy Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715). We had access to projectors and 
TVs, and sat roughly three participants per table. We encouraged students to switch 
their seating arrangements in order to make new connections. Our venue had fast
wifi, which was crucial to the success of our workshop and our use of RStudio cloud.
In a small group such as ours, it worked fine to have people use either their local
environment or the cloud, though inevitably doing so exposes bugs unique to a local
(unintended) environment that would be hard to get through with a large group.

## T4DS Panel

Dinner and a panel (especially if one has access to funding for these events), seemed 
to be a beneficial addition to the workshop. We recieved verbal feedback that the 
panel with a wide array of data science professionals was especially helpful. The 
panel included faculty in math, cs, statistics, and programming/data science industry 
careers. The panel was led by a current undergraduate student who has worked in our
group for several years, and was a peer for audience members.

## T4DS Event Assessment

Assessment is an important step that should not be forgotten. When designing
your assessment, consider the reason for offering the assessment:

* Do you plan to offer this workshop again and want to know how to improve it?
* Do you need to report to a funding agency?
* Do you plan to use the results in research? (If so, don't forget the IRB!)

See the [T4DS exit survey](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds-training/assets/T4DS-exit-survey.pdf)
as an example. You are welcome to use this one, or create your own.  When
creating your own, we suggest trying to find surveys that have been used before
rather than reinventing the wheel from scratch.

Note: it is perfectly ok to slip in assessment questions in the
[application/registration](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds-training/assets/T4DS-app.pdf).

Breakout room: how would different reasons for needing assessments affect the
types of questions that you might ask?
