## Getting Started

Let's start by getting to know each other.  Please introduce yourself with the
following:

* Name
* School
* Student? Faculty?
* Research interests
* Why you are here

## First Breakout

We will have open discussions about how to run workshops during our time
together, so let's first set some objectives for today and some ground rules.
Please discuss the following in your groups:

1. What is the objective of today's training overall? Your personal objectives?
2. What are some ground rules for how we should interact during our time
   together? (Do we want to usre "raise hand" feature, or just unmute, etc.)
